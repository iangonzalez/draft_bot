# Draft bot

Code to train and run a neural net that can recommend picks in a Magic: the Gathering
draft.

The data and models are not included in this repo; if you are planning on
replicating this work, I recommend using the public 17lands data sets at
https://www.17lands.com/public_datasets.

The deep learning methodology used for the model here is based in part on the paper at
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00655.pdf (Ward et al).
